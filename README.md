# BubleAnimation

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)](https://python.org)

This animation is created by exploring procedural-oriented paradighm in Python.
Also it is like a simple app for desktop. You can use it as a beautiful screen saver for your desktop.
The project is developed and was taken from beginner's platform [letpy](https://letpy.com/) what I recomend as well.

## Features
- The features of the animation items are derived from built-in module ```random```.
- So far it can works only on Windows system. 
- The basis of the project is .exe file extension.
- The most important thing it is converting python-file into executable-file with a library 
```auto-py-to-exe``` from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).
## Online review
- You can also try to [review it online](https://apps.letpy.com/animation_jumping_ovals) and look how it works. 
## Installation
- You can easily install this unofficial file [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_UjuMNXbzoYsHbtM22k3imOqd165nGYk/view?usp=sharing) and run on your windows system.

For beginners it is copletely useful to research, modify and improve functionality.
Enjoy your coding !!!
